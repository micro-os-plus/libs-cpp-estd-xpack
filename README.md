# A source library xPack with the ÂµOS++ embedded `std::` support

This project includes files that complement the C++ `std::` classes.

The project is hosted on GitHub as
[micro-os-plus/libs-cpp-estd-xpack](https://github.com/micro-os-plus/libs-cpp-estd-xpack).

## Maintainer info

This page is addressed to developers who plan to include this source
library into their own projects.

For maintainer info, please see the
[README-MAINTAINER](README-MAINTAINER.md) file.

## Install

As a source library xPack, the easiest way to add it to a project is via
**xpm**, but it can also be used as any Git project, for example as a submodule.

### Prerequisites

A recent [xpm](https://xpack.github.io/xpm/),
which is a portable [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) command line application.

It is recommended to update to the latest version with:

```sh
npm install --global xpm@latest
```

For details please follow the instructions in the
[xPack install](https://xpack.github.io/install/) page.

### xpm

Note: the package will be available from npmjs.com at a later date.

For now, it can be installed from GitHub:

```sh
cd my-project
xpm init # Unless a package.json is already present

xpm install github:micro-os-plus/libs-cpp-estd-xpack
```

When ready, this package will be available as
[`@micro-os-plus/libs-cpp-estd`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@micro-os-plus/libs-cpp-estd)
from the `npmjs.com` registry:

```sh
cd my-project
xpm init # Unless a package.json is already present

xpm install @micro-os-plus/libs-cpp-estd@latest

ls -l xpacks/micro-os-plus-libs-cpp-estd
```

### Git submodule

If, for any reason, **xpm** is not available, the next recommended
solution is to link it as a Git submodule below an `xpacks` folder.

```sh
cd my-project
git init # Unless already a Git project
mkdir -p xpacks

git submodule add https://github.com/micro-os-plus/libs-cpp-estd-xpack.git \
  xpacks/micro-os-plus-libs-cpp-estd
```

## Branches

Apart from the unused `master` branch, there are two active branches:

- `xpack`, with the latest stable version (default)
- `xpack-develop`, with the current development version

All development is done in the `xpack-develop` branch, and contributions via
Pull Requests should be directed to this branch.

When new releases are published, the `xpack-develop` branch is merged
into `xpack`.

## Developer info

The new classes are defined in the `micro_os_plus::estd` namespace. Having them
in a separate namespace allows to run tests on the synthetic POSIX platform.

Since the libraries included in the current embedded toolchain do not
include support for threads, it is possible to also define
the same functionality in the `std::` namespace, and reuse
source code from POSIX desktops.

### Status

The embedded std:: definitions are fully functional.
